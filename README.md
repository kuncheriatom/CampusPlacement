# CampusPlacement

## Overview
This project aims to predict student placement status using various machine learning models. The dataset includes student academic performance and other related features. The primary goal is to build and evaluate different classification models to identify the most effective one for predicting whether a student will be placed or not.

## Dataset
Features include gender, education percentages, boards, specializations, work experience, and placement status.

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
- Gradient Boosting

## Conclusion
This analysis provides insights into the factors influencing campus recruitment placements. The Voting Classifier, combining multiple models, offers a robust prediction method. Feature importance analysis indicates which academic and employability factors significantly impact placement outcomes, helping stakeholders make informed decisions
